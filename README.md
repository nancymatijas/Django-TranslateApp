- Section 2: Overall Description


## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

Translate-o-Rama is a web application designed to help users find the perfect
translator for their project, quickly and easily.

The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with an Admin
dashboard, User dashboard, and a public part with a list of translators and a
list of available jobs filterable by language and field. Users can click on a
particular Translator's profile and view their previous translations and
reviews. There is also an in-app messaging system for users to communicate with
translators.

Users can post jobs and receive quote requests from translators, as well as
view the estimated cost of their translation project.  Translations are
delivered through the app. Users are notified when the job is complete, and the
payment is handled using a cryptocurrency token. If there is a dispute or
disagreement between users and translators, an admin user will review the case
and make a decision.

Translate-o-Rama also offers a rating system for translators, as well as a
searchable database of translators so users can easily find the perfect
translator for their project. All translators must submit their credentials,
such as diplomas, which will be approved by an admin user. Unfortunately, there
is no automated quality assurance process.

With Translate-o-Rama, users will be able to quickly and easily find the
perfect translator for their project.

Translate-o-Rama is a self-contained web application that will be hosted on a
web server. It will be accessible through a web browser.


  
### 2.2 Product Functions

"Translate-o-Rama" will provide the following functions:

- User Interface: Users will be able to navigate between pages on the web 
 application, communicate with translators, view the names of the 
 translators working on their projects, contact a translator before 
 assigning a project, and view the estimated cost of their translation 
 projects.

- Job Posting and Assignment: Users will be able to post jobs and receive 
 quotes from translators, delete the jobs, 
 and request a specific translator for their translation project.

- Job Delivery and Payment: Users will be notified when their translations 
 are complete, and the web application will handle the delivery of 
 completed translations, disputes or disagreements between users and 
 translators, payments, and invoicing.

- Review System: The web application will include a rating system for 
 translators, as well as allow users to review the quality of their 
 translations.

- Job and Translator Search: The web application will provide a searchable 
 database of translators, and will verify the credentials and 
 qualifications of translators.


### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

The product will have three logical user classes: Admin, User, and Translator.
However, the web application will only have two user classes implemented: Admin and User.
Admin is a user class with a superuser status, and can access the Admin
dashboard. Admin users can create, edit, and delete users.

Each user can be both a User and a Translator. Every user can both post jobs 
and submit quotes. 


#### 2.3.1 Admin

Admin users will be able to manage the web application, including managing
users, managing translators, and managing jobs. Admin users will also be able
to review disputes and disagreements between users and translators. Since the app
wil use a cryptocurrency token, admin users will be able to manage the token
allocation to users and translators. 

#### 2.3.2 User

Users will be able to post jobs, assign jobs to translators, and view the
status of their jobs. Users will also be able to review the quality of their
translations.

#### 2.3.3 Translator

Translators will be able to view available jobs, submit quotes, and view the
status of their jobs. 

### 2.4 Operating Environment

The web application will be hosted on a web server. It will be accessible
through a web browser. 

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

The web application will be written in Python using the Django framework. It
will be hosted on a web server. The data will be stored in a SQLite database.
No further design and implementation constraints are known at this time.

### 2.6 User Documentation

No documentation will be provided to users.

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies

The application will use a cryptocurrency token to handle payments. For the
first version of the application, the amounts of tokens each user have will be
recorded as a field in the database and will be managed by admin users. The token
deposit and withdrawal funtionality will not be implemented in this version of
the application.

The application will not have an automated quality assurance process.

#### 3.1.3 Admin Requirements

Admin requirements focus on the specific funtionalities that Admins will be able
to use. Admins are created by the system administrator in the Admin Dashboard.
The Admins use the Django Admin interface to manage the system.

##### 3.1.3.1 Admin Dashboard

**Req A1** - The web application will provide a dashboard for admins to
manage the system. 

The web application will provide a dashboard for admins to manage the system.
The dashboard will use the Django Admin interface. The dashboard will allow

to change the user's token balance. The web application will update the user's
token balance in the database. The web application will display the new token
balance on the user's dashboard.

**Constrainst and considerations:**
The token balance is used for payments in the system. The token balance is
applied to the user's account when the user completes a job. The token balance
is deducted from the user's account when the user posts a job. 
The deposit and withdrawal of the tokens is outside the scope of this application.

The admins will verify the user's deposit outside of the application and will
apply the token balance to the user's account in the application. Likewise, the
admins will process the user's withdrawal requests outside of the application and
will deduct the token balance from the user's account in the application.

In this way, the application will not be responsible for the communication
between the users and the admins. All the communication between the users and
the admins regarding the token balances will be done outside of the
application. The admins will then apply the token balance to the user's account
through the Admin dashboard.

**Note:** The token balance is not a currency (yet). The token balance is a number
that represents the number of tokens that the user has in their account. The
token balance is used for payments in the system.


##### 3.1.3.3 Dispute Resolution

**Req A3** - The web application will allow admins to resolve disputes.

The web application will allow admins to resolve disputes. The web application
will allow the admins to find a dispute in the Admin dashboard and to resolve
the dispute. The dispute will be resolved by the admin manually. The admin will 
contact the job poster outside the application and will resolve the dispute
manually.  All the changes to the users' ratings or token balances will
be done manually by the admin from the Admin dashboard.

Once the dispute is resolved, the admin will close the dispute. The admin will
close the dispute by changing the status of the dispute to "Closed" in the
Admin dashboard. The web application will display the status of the dispute as
"Closed" on the user's dashboard.
